## Why Espresso Sequencer?

Ethereum L2 rollups are centralized. Take [Optimism Architecture](https://blockeden.xyz/blog/2023/04/15/optimism-architecture/) for example. The globally-single sequencer receives L2 transactions from L2 users, creates L2 blocks accordingly, and then submits to [data availability provider](https://tianpan.co/optimism-bedrock-specs/glossary.html#data-availability-provider) (via a [batcher](https://tianpan.co/optimism-bedrock-specs/glossary.html#batcher)). It also submits [output roots](https://tianpan.co/optimism-bedrock-specs/glossary.html#l2-output-root) to L1.

Espresso Sequencer is trying to decentralize it and then achieve credible neutrality, enhance interoperability, mitigate negative effects of MEV, and encourage long-term economic incentive alignment with L1 validators.
