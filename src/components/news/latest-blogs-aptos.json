Whether you are an experienced developer or a beginner, you can easily get started and use it effectively.\n\n## **How to Get Started with Aptos REST Playground?**\n\nEnter our API marketplace and select the Aptos card:\n\n![img](https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FwHKJoqtjHOgP_LiNqxJLh.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nInside the Aptos REST Playground interface, locate the `Test REST chain API` where you can see that we have integrated all the interfaces required for Aptos development:\n\n![img](https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FG0cNmuGv8kK8UA124qiIl.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nHere, you don't need any additional configuration; our playground is ready to use out of the box. Taking `Get Account` as an example, we will show you how to use Aptos REST Playground:\n\n1. Expand the `/account/{address}` table; we have preconfigured some parameters for you. Of course, you can also set your own parameters.\n2. Click the `Try it out` button, and you can access the interface using either our default parameters or any information you set yourself. You will immediately receive the data you need. Pay special attention to the data with an HTTP Code of `200`; it will be your primary focus. With this data, you can analyze any Aptos data request.\n\n![img](https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F_GH8ccGTeYkPRxVkrB6bb.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nSometimes, to test the speed and stability of the product, you may want to build a set of testing code on the frontend yourself. This is allowed and supported by us.\n\nBefore doing so, you need to first locate your BLOCKEDEN_API_KEY, which can be found at [https://blockeden.xyz/dash](https://blockeden.xyz/dash):\n\n![img](https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FJYYc1pr2bz-AKdwLSAvOa.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nIf you haven't created your own `BLOCKEDEN_API_KEY` yet, you can still use the public API key we provide: `8UuXzatAZYDBJC6YZTKD`.\n\nNow, let's create our own simple testing code based on React and the Aptos REST API:\n\n```js\nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\n\nfunction App() {\n  const [data, setData] = useState(null);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const address = '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000dead';\n    const apiEndpoint = `https://api.blockeden.xyz/aptos/8UuXzatAZYDBJC6YZTKD/v1/accounts/${address}`;\n\n    const fetchData = async () => {\n      try {\n        const response = await fetch(apiEndpoint, {\n          method: 'get',\n          headers: {\n            'Content-Type': 'application/json'\n          }\n        });\n\n        if (!response.ok) {\n          throw new Error('Network response was not ok');\n        }\n\n        const result = await response.json();\n        setData(result);\n\n      } catch (error) {\n        console.error('API Request Error:', error);\n      }\n    };\n\n    fetchData();\n  }, []);\n\n  return (\n    <div className=\"App\">\n      <h1>Aptos Indexer GraphQL Example</h1>\n      {data ? (\n        <pre>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</pre>\n      ) : (\n        <p>Loading...</p>\n      )}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n```\n\nWe also support `cURL` testing:\n\n```plain\ncurl -L -X GET 'https://api.blockeden.xyz/aptos/8UuXzatAZYDBJC6YZTKD/v1/accounts/0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000dead' \\\\\n-H 'Accept: application/json'\n```\n\nAptos REST Playground is a powerful development tool for Aptos, designed to simplify the process of Aptos development and testing. We hope it provides developers with a better working experience and contributes to the creation of exceptional applications. If you have any feedback or suggestions, please don't hesitate to contact us.

    "content": "We are excited to announce some great news to the community: After a period of development, we have launched a GraphQL playground based on the Aptos API. This is designed to assist you in building Aptos applications faster and better.\n\nIt is widely known that in today's world of software development, building efficient, flexible, and scalable APIs is of paramount importance. APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) serve as the bridge for communication and data exchange between different software systems, making well-designed APIs crucial for the success of applications. GraphQL has already become the preferred tool for many developers in building flexible and powerful APIs.\n\nToday, we are thrilled to announce Aptos Indexer GraphQL, a high-performance GraphQL framework designed specifically for Aptos developers. It is aimed at simplifying the development and management of Aptos APIs while delivering outstanding performance and scalability.\n\n### What is GraphQL?\n\nFirst, let's take a look at what GraphQL is all about. GraphQL is a query language and runtime environment for APIs that allows clients to precisely specify the data they need, instead of receiving data in fixed formats like traditional REST APIs. This flexibility makes GraphQL particularly well-suited for building client-driven applications, such as single-page applications (SPAs) and mobile apps.\n\nThe core idea of GraphQL is \"only get the data you need.\" Clients can retrieve multiple resources through a single request and specify the fields they need for each resource. This reduces the issues of over-fetching or under-fetching data, thereby improving network efficiency.\n\n### Why choose Aptos Indexer GraphQL?\n\nAptos Indexer GraphQL is a high-performance GraphQL API tailor-made for Aptos developers. It aims to provide the following advantages to Aptos developers:\n\n1. **Simplified development process**\n\n   Aptos Indexer GraphQL simplifies the API development process by offering a clear and intuitive API definition language and tools. Developers can easily define data types, queries, mutations, and resolvers, making API construction highly intuitive.\n\n2. **Outstanding performance**\n\n   Aptos Indexer GraphQL is designed as a high-performance framework. It utilizes modern data-loading techniques to ensure that only necessary database queries are executed, thereby reducing response times and enhancing performance.\n\n3. **Scalability**\n\n   Aptos Indexer GraphQL can meet your needs regardless of the scale of your application. It supports a modular architecture, allowing for easy addition of new features and data types.\n\n4. **Powerful utilities**\n\n   Aptos Indexer GraphQL provides a set of GraphQL-based testing tools, including GraphiQL, which allows you to interactively validate the required data in real-time, making it easier for you to develop, test, and maintain the API.\n\n### How to get started with Aptos Indexer GraphQL?\n\nFirst, select the Aptos Indexer service in our API marketplace:\n\n![blockeden.xyz api marketplace](https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FkR9Td6tTD5hedRhH_597Z.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nblockeden.xyz api marketplace\n\nThen, copy your `BLOCKEDEN_API_KEY` at https://blockeden.xyz/dash:\n\n![BLOCKEDEN_API_KEY](https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FC5H-pjlZCQdNnnC5eB5S2.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nBLOCKEDEN_API_KEY\n\nAfter receiving a success message, you can start using the Aptos Indexer GraphQL service.\n\nIf you haven't created a `BLOCKEDEN_API_KEY` yet, you can still use the public API key: `8UuXzatAZYDBJC6YZTKD`.\n\nHere is a simple example of using `React` to connect to the Aptos Indexer GraphQL service:\n\n```tsx\nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\n\nfunction App() {\n   const [data, setData] = useState(null);\n\n   useEffect(() => {\n      const apiEndpoint = 'https://api.blockeden.xyz/aptos/indexer/8UuXzatAZYDBJC6YZTKD/v1/graphql';\n\n      const fetchData = async () => {\n         try {\n            const response = await fetch(apiEndpoint, {\n               method: 'POST',\n               headers: {\n                  'Content-Type': 'application/json'\n               },\n               body: JSON.stringify({\n                  query: `\n              query {\n                block_metadata_transactions(limit: 2) {\n                  block_height\n                }\n              }\n            `,\n               }),\n            });\n\n            if (!response.ok) {\n               throw new Error('Network response was not ok');\n            }\n\n            const result = await response.json();\n            setData(result.data);\n\n         } catch (error) {\n            console.error('GraphQL Request Error:', error);\n         }\n      };\n\n      fetchData();\n   }, []);\n\n   return (\n           <div className=\"App\">\n              <h1>Aptos Indexer GraphQL Example</h1>\n              {data ? (\n                      <pre>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</pre>\n              ) : (\n                      <p>Loading...</p>\n              )}\n           </div>\n   );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n```\n\nYou can also directly access our built-in GraphiQL service, located at the bottom of the https://blockeden.xyz/api-marketplace/aptos-indexer page.\n\n![Aptos Indexer GraphQL service for blockeden.xyz](https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F9tFzqCI50Bnjcl4PgMsnW.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nAptos Indexer GraphQL service for blockeden.xyz\n\nAlternatively, you can directly access Aptos Indexer GraphQL using curl:\n\n```\ncurl https://api.blockeden.xyz/aptos/indexer/8UuXzatAZYDBJC6YZTKD/v1/graphql \\\n-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n-X POST \\\n-d '{\"query\":\"query {block_metadata_transactions(limit: 2) {block_height}}\"}'\n```\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAptos Indexer GraphQL is a powerful development service within the Aptos ecosystem, designed to streamline the development and management of Aptos APIs while delivering exceptional performance and scalability.
