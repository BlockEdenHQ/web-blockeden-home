    "content": "In modern software development, building robust APIs is crucial. APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) serve as the key for communication and data exchange between different software systems, and an API that is easy to use and test can greatly accelerate the development process. We are excited to announce that we have introduced a brand new feature for Aptos - Aptos REST Playground. This is a high-availability API toolkit based on Aptos development, designed to assist you in building Aptos applications faster and better.\n\n## **What is Aptos REST Playground?**\n\nAptos REST Playground is an interactive Web3 application designed to assist developers in exploring, testing, and understanding the Aptos API with ease. It provides an intuitive [Swagger-based](https://swagger.io/) interactive interface that allows you to construct and send REST requests, view responses, and test to analyze data.\n\nThis tool enables Aptos developers to gain a better understanding of Aptos functionality and build exceptional Aptos applications more quickly and efficiently.\n\n## **Why Choose Aptos REST Playground?**\n\nAptos REST Playground is a high-performance REST API customized specifically for Aptos developers by [Blockeden.xyz](https://blockeden.xyz/). It aims to provide the following advantages to Aptos developers:\n\n1. **Interactive API Testing**\n\nAptos REST Playground allows you to conduct interactive API testing without leaving your browser. It is an interactive application built on [Swagger](https://swagger.io/). You can construct and customize requests, view real-time responses, and make adjustments as needed. This greatly simplifies the process of API testing and debugging.\n\n2. **Real-time Data Analysis**\n\nYou can directly view the data in the API responses within Aptos REST Playground, without the need to write additional code or use third-party tools. This makes it easier for you to comprehend the information returned by the API, facilitating the development of better applications.\n\n3. **User-Friendly**\n\nThe user interface of Aptos REST Playground is highly intuitive, requiring no complex setup or configuration. Whether you are an experienced developer or a beginner, you can easily get started and use it effectively.\n\n## **How to Get Started with Aptos REST Playground?**\n\nEnter our API marketplace and select the Aptos card:\n\n![img](https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FwHKJoqtjHOgP_LiNqxJLh.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nInside the Aptos REST Playground interface, locate the `Test REST chain API` where you can see that we have integrated all the interfaces required for Aptos development:\n\n![img](https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FG0cNmuGv8kK8UA124qiIl.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nHere, you don't need any additional configuration; our playground is ready to use out of the box. Taking `Get Account` as an example, we will show you how to use Aptos REST Playground:\n\n1. Expand the `/account/{address}` table; we have preconfigured some parameters for you. Of course, you can also set your own parameters.\n2. Click the `Try it out` button, and you can access the interface using either our default parameters or any information you set yourself. You will immediately receive the data you need. Pay special attention to the data with an HTTP Code of `200`; it will be your primary focus. With this data, you can analyze any Aptos data request.\n\n![img](https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F_GH8ccGTeYkPRxVkrB6bb.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nSometimes, to test the speed and stability of the product, you may want to build a set of testing code on the frontend yourself. This is allowed and supported by us.\n\nBefore doing so, you need to first locate your BLOCKEDEN_API_KEY, which can be found at [https://blockeden.xyz/dash](https://blockeden.xyz/dash):\n\n![img](https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FJYYc1pr2bz-AKdwLSAvOa.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nIf you haven't created your own `BLOCKEDEN_API_KEY` yet, you can still use the public API key we provide: `8UuXzatAZYDBJC6YZTKD`.\n\nNow, let's create our own simple testing code based on React and the Aptos REST API:\n\n```js\nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\n\nfunction App() {\n  const [data, setData] = useState(null);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const address = '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000dead';\n    const apiEndpoint = `https://api.blockeden.xyz/aptos/8UuXzatAZYDBJC6YZTKD/v1/accounts/${address}`;\n\n    const fetchData = async () => {\n      try {\n        const response = await fetch(apiEndpoint, {\n          method: 'get',\n          headers: {\n            'Content-Type': 'application/json'\n          }\n        });\n\n        if (!response.ok) {\n          throw new Error('Network response was not ok');\n        }\n\n        const result = await response.json();\n        setData(result);\n\n      } catch (error) {\n        console.error('API Request Error:', error);\n      }\n    };\n\n    fetchData();\n  }, []);\n\n  return (\n    <div className=\"App\">\n      <h1>Aptos Indexer GraphQL Example</h1>\n      {data ? (\n        <pre>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</pre>\n      ) : (\n        <p>Loading...</p>\n      )}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n```\n\nWe also support `cURL` testing:\n\n```plain\ncurl -L -X GET 'https://api.blockeden.xyz/aptos/8UuXzatAZYDBJC6YZTKD/v1/accounts/0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000dead' \\\\\n-H 'Accept: application/json'\n```\n\nAptos REST Playground is a powerful development tool for Aptos, designed to simplify the process of Aptos development and testing. We hope it provides developers with a better working experience and contributes to the creation of exceptional applications. If you have any feedback or suggestions, please don't hesitate to contact us. Thank you for your attention!\n\n------\n\n- Twitter: [https://twitter.com/BlockEdenHQ](https://twitter.com/BlockEdenHQ)\n- Discord: [https://discord.gg/4Yfvs2HWey](https://discord.gg/4Yfvs2HWey)\n- Source Link: https://blockeden.xyz/blog/2023/09/20/blockeden-xyz-launches-aptos-rest-playground/"

    "content": "As the CEO of a startup in the web3 domain, I'm often intrigued by emerging tech trends. The rapid ascent of bot platforms, particularly in the context of blockchain and decentralized finance, has caught my attention.\n\n## The New Wave: Telegram Bots in Web3\n\nWith the growth of Unibot, robot concepts are becoming a new area of competition. The landscape now features hundreds of bot-centric and micro-innovative projects. Telegram, a must-have social application in the crypto circle, boasts a staggering 800 million monthly active users. These numbers become even more fascinating when you consider how Telegram Bots are simplifying crypto interactions. Within the platform, bots can handle a variety of tasks, from decentralized finance (DeFi) and miner extractable value (MEV) protection to data analytics, whale tracking, and even community gaming governance. The appeal lies in their accessibility, convenience, and wide-ranging applications.\n\nHowever, rapid growth often brings skepticism and worries. Concerns about the security vulnerabilities of Telegram Bots and the maturity of the technology have begun to surface.\n\n![The Rise of Web3 Bots: Analyzing Unibot and Its Contenders](https://tp-misc.b-cdn.net/blockeden/bot-and-money.png \"The Rise of Web3 Bots: Analyzing Unibot and Its Contenders\")\n\n## Unibot: The Phenomenon\n\nLaunched in June, Unibot took just two months to achieve a phenomenal status, spawning hundreds of imitative projects. It hit a peak market cap of over $200 million, although it later faced stiff competition from \"Banana Gun\", leading to a considerable market share decline. Despite this drop, its current market value stands around $60 million, keeping Unibot as the leading figure in the bot arena.\n\n*Unibot Features*:\n\n- New project tracking\n- Copy-trading capabilities\n- Limit orders\n- Token tracking and precision sniping within Telegram\n- Speedier than conventional decentralized exchanges, outpacing platforms like Uniswap.\n\n*Revenue Model*:\n\n1. **Service Fee**: Unibot charges a 1% service fee. 40% of this is allocated to $UNIBOT Token holders, with the remaining going toward team operations.\n2. **$UNIBOT Token Tax**: The token imposes a 5% tax. 1% of the transaction volume is shared with $UNIBOT holders.\n\nIn its prime, daily revenue reached beyond 300 ETH. Despite challenging market conditions, Unibot has performed impressively, garnering approximately 15,000 users and generating around 8,200 ETH (approx. $13 million) in total revenue within three months.\n\n## Banana Gun: The Challenger\n\nBanana Gun, a recent entrant, has managed to challenge Unibot's dominance. With features similar to Unibot, it has garnered a user base comparable in size, but with slightly more active members. Notably, it's proving to be more effective in its \"sniping\" capabilities. Banana Gun's recent pre-sale raised 800 ETH, and they faced some liquidity withdrawal issues due to contract tax complications.\n\n## The Broader Bot Ecosystem\n\nOther bots in the market focus on various niche aspects, such as:\n- Analyzing contract details for potential red flags, like liquidity pool locks, contract access renunciations, and \"rug pull\" possibilities.\n- Tracking the actions of high-performing wallet addresses.\n- Monitoring newly launched project tokens for potential early investment opportunities.\n\n## Why Are Bots Gaining Traction?\n\n1. Their integration with Telegram, one of the most widely-used applications in the industry, provides a natural congregation of traffic.\n2. The essence of buying and selling remains a fundamental need in finance. The functionalities of these bots revolve around trading, and ultimately, profitability is their selling point.\n\nIn conclusion, the world of web3 bots is evolving rapidly. As decentralized technologies mature, bots will undoubtedly play a significant role in the way we interact with and leverage the capabilities of the blockchain. As a stakeholder in this space, I'm excited to be a part of this journey and look forward to the innovations that lie ahead.\n\n------\n\n- Twitter: [https://twitter.com/BlockEdenHQ](https://twitter.com/BlockEdenHQ)\n- Discord: [https://discord.gg/4Yfvs2HWey](https://discord.gg/4Yfvs2HWey)\n- Source Link: https://blockeden.xyz/blog/2023/09/16/web3-bots-rise-unibot-vs-banana-gun/"
