    "content": "As the CEO of a startup in the web3 domain, I'm often intrigued by emerging tech trends. The rapid ascent of bot platforms, particularly in the context of blockchain and decentralized finance, has caught my attention.\n\n## The New Wave: Telegram Bots in Web3\n\nWith the growth of Unibot, robot concepts are becoming a new area of competition. The landscape now features hundreds of bot-centric and micro-innovative projects. Telegram, a must-have social application in the crypto circle, boasts a staggering 800 million monthly active users. These numbers become even more fascinating when you consider how Telegram Bots are simplifying crypto interactions. Within the platform, bots can handle a variety of tasks, from decentralized finance (DeFi) and miner extractable value (MEV) protection to data analytics, whale tracking, and even community gaming governance. The appeal lies in their accessibility, convenience, and wide-ranging applications.\n\nHowever, rapid growth often brings skepticism and worries. Concerns about the security vulnerabilities of Telegram Bots and the maturity of the technology have begun to surface.\n\n![The Rise of Web3 Bots: Analyzing Unibot and Its Contenders](https://tp-misc.b-cdn.net/blockeden/bot-and-money.png \"The Rise of Web3 Bots: Analyzing Unibot and Its Contenders\")\n\n## Unibot: The Phenomenon\n\nLaunched in June, Unibot took just two months to achieve a phenomenal status, spawning hundreds of imitative projects. It hit a peak market cap of over $200 million, although it later faced stiff competition from \"Banana Gun\", leading to a considerable market share decline. Despite this drop, its current market value stands around $60 million, keeping Unibot as the leading figure in the bot arena.\n\n*Unibot Features*:\n\n- New project tracking\n- Copy-trading capabilities\n- Limit orders\n- Token tracking and precision sniping within Telegram\n- Speedier than conventional decentralized exchanges, outpacing platforms like Uniswap.\n\n*Revenue Model*:\n\n1. **Service Fee**: Unibot charges a 1% service fee. 40% of this is allocated to $UNIBOT Token holders, with the remaining going toward team operations.\n2. **$UNIBOT Token Tax**: The token imposes a 5% tax. 1% of the transaction volume is shared with $UNIBOT holders.\n\nIn its prime, daily revenue reached beyond 300 ETH. Despite challenging market conditions, Unibot has performed impressively, garnering approximately 15,000 users and generating around 8,200 ETH (approx. $13 million) in total revenue within three months.\n\n## Banana Gun: The Challenger\n\nBanana Gun, a recent entrant, has managed to challenge Unibot's dominance. With features similar to Unibot, it has garnered a user base comparable in size, but with slightly more active members. Notably, it's proving to be more effective in its \"sniping\" capabilities. Banana Gun's recent pre-sale raised 800 ETH, and they faced some liquidity withdrawal issues due to contract tax complications.\n\n## The Broader Bot Ecosystem\n\nOther bots in the market focus on various niche aspects, such as:\n- Analyzing contract details for potential red flags, like liquidity pool locks, contract access renunciations, and \"rug pull\" possibilities.\n- Tracking the actions of high-performing wallet addresses.\n- Monitoring newly launched project tokens for potential early investment opportunities.\n\n## Why Are Bots Gaining Traction?\n\n1. Their integration with Telegram, one of the most widely-used applications in the industry, provides a natural congregation of traffic.\n2. The essence of buying and selling remains a fundamental need in finance. The functionalities of these bots revolve around trading, and ultimately, profitability is their selling point.\n\nIn conclusion, the world of web3 bots is evolving rapidly. As decentralized technologies mature, bots will undoubtedly play a significant role in the way we interact with and leverage the capabilities of the blockchain. As a stakeholder in this space, I'm excited to be a part of this journey and look forward to the innovations that lie ahead.\n\n------\n\n- Twitter: [https://twitter.com/BlockEdenHQ](https://twitter.com/BlockEdenHQ)\n- Discord: [https://discord.gg/4Yfvs2HWey](https://discord.gg/4Yfvs2HWey)\n- Source Link: https://blockeden.xyz/blog/2023/09/16/web3-bots-rise-unibot-vs-banana-gun/"

    "content": "We are excited to announce some great news to the community: After a period of development, we have launched a GraphQL playground based on the Aptos API. This is designed to assist you in building Aptos applications faster and better.\n\nIt is widely known that in today's world of software development, building efficient, flexible, and scalable APIs is of paramount importance. APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) serve as the bridge for communication and data exchange between different software systems, making well-designed APIs crucial for the success of applications. GraphQL has already become the preferred tool for many developers in building flexible and powerful APIs.\n\nToday, we are thrilled to announce Aptos Indexer GraphQL, a high-performance GraphQL framework designed specifically for Aptos developers. It is aimed at simplifying the development and management of Aptos APIs while delivering outstanding performance and scalability.\n\n### What is GraphQL?\n\nFirst, let's take a look at what GraphQL is all about. GraphQL is a query language and runtime environment for APIs that allows clients to precisely specify the data they need, instead of receiving data in fixed formats like traditional REST APIs. This flexibility makes GraphQL particularly well-suited for building client-driven applications, such as single-page applications (SPAs) and mobile apps.\n\nThe core idea of GraphQL is \"only get the data you need.\" Clients can retrieve multiple resources through a single request and specify the fields they need for each resource. This reduces the issues of over-fetching or under-fetching data, thereby improving network efficiency.\n\n### Why choose Aptos Indexer GraphQL?\n\nAptos Indexer GraphQL is a high-performance GraphQL API tailor-made for Aptos developers by [blockeden.xyz](http:). It aims to provide the following advantages to Aptos developers:\n\n1. **Simplified development process**\n\n   Aptos Indexer GraphQL simplifies the API development process by offering a clear and intuitive API definition language and tools. Developers can easily define data types, queries, mutations, and resolvers, making API construction highly intuitive.\n\n2. **Outstanding performance**\n\n   Aptos Indexer GraphQL is designed as a high-performance framework. It utilizes modern data-loading techniques to ensure that only necessary database queries are executed, thereby reducing response times and enhancing performance.\n\n3. **Scalability**\n\n   Aptos Indexer GraphQL can meet your needs regardless of the scale of your application. It supports a modular architecture, allowing for easy addition of new features and data types.\n\n4. **Powerful utilities**\n\n   Aptos Indexer GraphQL provides a set of GraphQL-based testing tools, including GraphiQL, which allows you to interactively validate the required data in real-time, making it easier for you to develop, test, and maintain the API.\n\n### How to get started with Aptos Indexer GraphQL?\n\nFirst, select the Aptos Indexer service in our API marketplace:\n\n![blockeden.xyz api marketplace](https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FkR9Td6tTD5hedRhH_597Z.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nblockeden.xyz api marketplace\n\nThen, copy your `BLOCKEDEN_API_KEY` at https://blockeden.xyz/dash:\n\n![BLOCKEDEN_API_KEY](https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FC5H-pjlZCQdNnnC5eB5S2.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nBLOCKEDEN_API_KEY\n\nAfter receiving a success message, you can start using the Aptos Indexer GraphQL service.\n\nIf you haven't created a `BLOCKEDEN_API_KEY` yet, you can still use the public API key: `8UuXzatAZYDBJC6YZTKD`.\n\nHere is a simple example of using `React` to connect to the Aptos Indexer GraphQL service:\n\n```tsx\nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\n\nfunction App() {\n  const [data, setData] = useState(null);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const apiEndpoint = 'https://api.blockeden.xyz/aptos/indexer/8UuXzatAZYDBJC6YZTKD/v1/graphql';\n\n    const fetchData = async () => {\n      try {\n        const response = await fetch(apiEndpoint, {\n          method: 'POST',\n          headers: {\n            'Content-Type': 'application/json'\n          },\n          body: JSON.stringify({\n            query: `\n              query {\n                block_metadata_transactions(limit: 2) {\n                  block_height\n                }\n              }\n            `,\n          }),\n        });\n\n        if (!response.ok) {\n          throw new Error('Network response was not ok');\n        }\n\n        const result = await response.json();\n        setData(result.data);\n\n      } catch (error) {\n        console.error('GraphQL Request Error:', error);\n      }\n    };\n\n    fetchData();\n  }, []);\n\n  return (\n    <div className=\"App\">\n      <h1>Aptos Indexer GraphQL Example</h1>\n      {data ? (\n        <pre>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</pre>\n      ) : (\n        <p>Loading...</p>\n      )}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n```\n\nYou can also directly access our built-in GraphiQL service, located at the bottom of the https://blockeden.xyz/api-marketplace/aptos-indexer page.\n\n![Aptos Indexer GraphQL service for blockeden.xyz](https://mirror.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2F9tFzqCI50Bnjcl4PgMsnW.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nAptos Indexer GraphQL service for blockeden.xyz\n\nAlternatively, you can directly access Aptos Indexer GraphQL using curl:\n\n```\ncurl https://api.blockeden.xyz/aptos/indexer/8UuXzatAZYDBJC6YZTKD/v1/graphql \\\n-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n-X POST \\\n-d '{\"query\":\"query {block_metadata_transactions(limit: 2) {block_height}}\"}'\n```\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAptos Indexer GraphQL is a powerful development service within the Aptos ecosystem, designed to streamline the development and management of Aptos APIs while delivering exceptional performance and scalability.
