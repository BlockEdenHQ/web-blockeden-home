    "content": "## **Why Espresso sequencer?**\n\nEthereum L2 rollups are centralized. Take [Optimism Architecture](https://blockeden.xyz/blog/2023/04/15/optimism-architecture/) for example. The globally-single sequencer receives L2 transactions from L2 users, creates L2 blocks accordingly, and then submits to [data availability provider](https://tianpan.co/optimism-bedrock-specs/glossary.html#data-availability-provider) (via a [batcher](https://tianpan.co/optimism-bedrock-specs/glossary.html#batcher)). It also submits [output roots](https://tianpan.co/optimism-bedrock-specs/glossary.html#l2-output-root) to L1.\n\nEspresso is trying to decentralize such sequencer and then achieve credible neutrality, enhance interoperability, mitigate the negative effects of MEV, and encourage long-term economic incentive alignment with L1 validators.\n\n## **How does it work with rollups?**\n\nBefore the shared sequencer:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ls8rBQq.png)\n\nAfter introducing the shared sequencer:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/2Fcii43.png)\n\n\n## **What is our motivation to join the Espresso Sequencer as an operator?**\n\n1. Shared vision for solving the composability problem between rollups on Ethereum.\n2. A passion for Yale alums's project.\n3. Our partnership with token holders willing to stake with us and Espresso Sequencer.\n4. Our business model ($45M staked and 21 chains' APIs supported) is built on the decentralization of L1s and L2s.\n5. Our expertise with high availability infrastructure fits into the need.\n6. We contribute to the ecosystem. e.g., Sui indexer, Aptos indexer, explorer, docs, community events, etc.\n\n## **What differentiates us from our competitors?**\n\n1. We use Ssilicon VValley standard techniques to run and monitor our infrastructure.\n2. We started with Aptos with a 99.99% uptime and expanded to include Sui, Solana, and 12 EVM blockchains. Now, there are $45M staked and 21 chains' APIs supported.\n3. We host community events with 10x.pub and offer educational sessions around blockchain system design.\n4. We make ecosystem contributions and build SaaS or mobile apps to improve the user experience.\n\n## **What slashing protection(s) do we offer?**\n\n1. Uptime monitoring transparently with 7/24 hours of on-call rotation among our team.\n2. Use on-call playbook and failover techniques to handle failures.\n3. Use hot standby if necessary.\n4. Committed to staying engaged with the community and upgrading service timely.\n\n## **How do we secure our infrastructure?**\n\nWe proactively use AWS key management service, HTTPs, MFA with YubiKey for cloud accounts, Cloudflare for DDoS, rate limiter, authorization and access control, zero trust architecture, security by design when building our infra, etc. Our team comprises IoTeX founding members and security engineers from Uber and Google."

Develop tools to improve efficiency, e.g., distributing rewards.\n\nInternal FAQs\n\n### What are the OKRs for Delegated Staking Infra Trying to Achieve?\n\nGoals:\n* Build a reliable, safe, extensible, and cost-efficient delegated staking infrastructure to sustainably generate revenue streams for BlockEden.xyz.\n  * Reliable: the delegate node should have high availability.\n  * Safe: the funds delegated to us should be safe.\n  * Extensible: the infra should be reusable to expand to another blockchain network.\n  * Cost-efficient: the infra machine cost should be covered by the delegate revenue.\n\n| Items                       | Key Results                |\n| --------------------------- | -------------------------- |\n| SLO server uptime           | 99.9%                      |\n| New network onboarding time | \\<= 2 weeks for EVM chains |\n\n### Why is Delegated Staking Infra Important to BlockEden.xyz?\n\n* It’s the revenue-generating program, bringing resources to do more strategic infra work.\n* It’s an essential infra component to serve chain RPCs, particularly for latency-sensitive use cases.\n\n### How Can Delegated Staking Infra Fail? Would it Cause Customer Dislikes?\n\n* Failures in delegated staking infrastructure primarily occur due to service disruptions and server downtime. These issues can prevent customers from staking tokens or lead to reduced rewards due to slashing penalties. Such disruptions often result in customer dissatisfaction due to unmet expectations of consistent earnings and reliable service.\n\n### What are the Dependencies?\n\n* Network Selection: The chosen blockchain network plays a critical role. Different networks may have varying protocols, reward structures, and security requirements.\n* Initial Funding: To participate as a validator in the staking process, an initial investment or fund is required. This amount varies depending on the network's criteria and serves as your stake in the network.\n\n### What are the Risks?\n\n* Fund Safety: Ideally, we should make a product that doesn’t bear the liability for the customer's fund. However, it largely depends on the blockchain's features, e.g., isolation of token owner and node operator permission.\n* Crypto Market Volatility: In a sudden crypto price crash or bearish market, the token rewards might be short to cover the machine cost. A liquidation plan should be in place to ensure funds are secured to operate the infra.\n\n### How to Use this Staking Infra?\n\n* BlockEden.xyz offers comprehensive documentation for getting started with our staking infrastructure, including step-by-step guides for both manual staking processes\n\n### **Why does staking infra matter to me?**\n\n- **Ease of Access**: You can easily participate in staking and enjoy its benefits without needing deep technical knowledge or extensive resources.\n- **Flexibility for Future Growth**: We provide the capability for future technical integrations with your needs, ensuring that as your staking needs evolve, our infrastructure can accommodate them.\n\n### **How to use this staking infra?**\n\n- To get started with our staking infrastructure, BlockEden.xyz offers comprehensive documentation.
