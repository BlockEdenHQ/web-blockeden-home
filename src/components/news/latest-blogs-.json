    "content": "The surge in popularity of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology have brought along significant scalability challenges. Blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum face heightened demand as the interest in decentralized applications (DApps) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) increase. This has led to platforms like BlockEden.xyz, a software powerhouse based in San Francisco, to seek scalable solutions. Enter NEAR Protocol, an open-source platform launched in 2020 as a decentralized cloud infrastructure to host DApps.\n\n## A Brief Overview of NEAR Protocol\n\nNEAR Protocol is a layer-1 blockchain that uses Nightshade, a unique sharding technology, to achieve scalability. It offers cross-chain interoperability through the Rainbow Bridge and a layer-2 solution called Aurora. Users can bridge ERC-20 tokens and assets from the Ethereum blockchain to the NEAR Protocol network, enabling access to higher throughput and lower transaction fees. The native token of the NEAR Protocol, NEAR, is used for paying transaction and data storage fees. NEAR token holders can also stake their tokens on the NEAR wallet to receive rewards or use them to vote for governance proposals.\n\nThe team behind NEAR Protocol is on a mission to address scalability limitations through sharding. Co-founded by Alex Skidanov and Illia Polosukhin in 2020, NEAR Protocol features a wide range of programming tools and languages, along with smart contracts with cross-chain functionality. These tools and features, coupled with a simplified onboarding process and human-readable account names, make NEAR Protocol a developer-friendly platform.\n\n<div style={{ display: \"flex\", width: \"100%\", justifyContent: \"center\" }}>\n  <iframe\n    src=\"https://blockedenxyz.substack.com/embed\"\n    width=\"480\"\n    height=\"320\"\n    frameborder=\"0\"\n    scrolling=\"no\"\n  ></iframe>\n</div>\n\n\n## Integration of NEAR Protocol into BlockEden.xyz\n\nThe integration of NEAR Protocol into BlockEden.xyz's API marketplace offers developers a scalable, secure, and efficient platform for creating groundbreaking decentralized applications. BlockEden.xyz, already known for its robust security and impressive uptime record, has enhanced its offerings by introducing NEAR Protocol.\n\n## Understanding NEAR's Core Technology: Nightshade Sharding\n\nNightshade is the innovative sharding technology that forms the backbone of the NEAR Protocol. It enables the efficient processing of data by distributing the workload across multiple validator nodes. Each node handles only a fraction of the network’s transactions, allowing for a higher number of transactions per second. The dynamic adjustment of nodes based on network traffic ensures overall efficiency and low transaction fees.\n\n\n## Bridging Networks with Rainbow Bridge\n\nRainbow Bridge, an application on NEAR Protocol, enables the transfer of ERC-20 tokens, stablecoins, wrapped tokens, and even NFTs between Ethereum and NEAR blockchains. This allows users to benefit from the higher throughput and lower fees on the NEAR Protocol. The Rainbow Bridge operates in a fully permissionless and decentralized manner, locking tokens on Ethereum and creating corresponding tokens on NEAR to maintain a constant circulating supply.\n\n## Unleashing Efficiency with Aurora\n\nAurora, a layer-2 solution on the NEAR Protocol blockchain, is designed to host thousands of transactions per second with an approximate block confirmation time of 2 seconds. Comprising the Aurora Engine and the Aurora Bridge, it offers compatibility with Ethereum and supports all tools available in the Ethereum ecosystem, making it easy for developers to transition to NEAR.\n\n## Staking and Governance with NEAR Token\n\nNEAR, the native token of the NEAR ecosystem, serves as the medium for transaction and storage fees. Token holders can stake their NEAR to run validating nodes, participate in governance by voting on platform decisions, and submit proposals.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe blockchain space continues to evolve, and platforms offering lower transaction costs and increased throughput are likely to drive mainstream adoption. The integration of NEAR Protocol into BlockEden.xyz's API marketplace is not just a mere upgrade; it's a significant step towards that future. With scalable solutions like sharding and cross-chain bridges, NEAR Protocol provides the ideal environment for developers to build efficient DApps and DeFi products. Together with BlockEden.xyz, NEAR Protocol is set to redefine the boundaries of blockchain technology.\n\n<div style={{ display: \"flex\", width: \"100%\", justifyContent: \"center\" }}>\n  <iframe\n    src=\"https://blockedenxyz.substack.com/embed\"\n    width=\"480\"\n    height=\"320\"\n    frameborder=\"0\"\n    scrolling=\"no\"\n  ></iframe>\n</div>\n\n\n- Twitter: https://twitter.com/BlockEdenHQ\n- Discord: https://discord.gg/4Yfvs2HWey\n- Source Link: https://blockeden.xyz/blog/2023/07/14/beyond-boundaries-the-integration-of-near-protocol-into-blockedenxyzs-api-marketplace/"

    "content": "In the bustling world of blockchain and decentralized applications, QuickNode has established itself as a formidable force. But as we take a closer look, we might ask: Why isn't QuickNode good enough? Let's dive into the nitty-gritty details of this intriguing matter.\n\n## **QuickNode’s Business Model - The Success Recipe**\n\nQuickNode offers an exemplary performance, with its speed being 2.5 times faster than competitors. This speed isn't just a claim; it's backed by actual performance metrics, which you can check out on their comparative page.\n\nWith the flexibility to handle 15+ chains and a mind-boggling 99.99% availability - SLA guaranteed no less - QuickNode offers unparalleled reliability in the space. Furthermore, they've successfully onboarded some big guns like Google, Visa, Adidas, and Coinbase. They've also courted long-term internet investors, including 776 Ventures, Tiger Global, Softbank, and more. But remember the elephant in the room - why QuickNode is not good enough? We'll get to that.\n\n### The Four Pillars of Revenue\n\n**Node Management**\n\nQuickNode's Node Management Platform is the company's flagship product and primary source of revenue. With a dual-tiered model, it offers self-service options for developers and businesses who want hands-on access, as well as enterprise-grade solutions for larger corporations. This approach covers a wide range of customer needs, from small startups to industry juggernauts.\n\n- **Self-service Options:** This is ideal for developers or small-scale organizations that require on-demand access to blockchain networks. It offers flexibility and control, allowing them to deploy nodes and manage their applications as needed.\n\n- **Enterprise-grade Solutions:** For larger corporations with more complex needs, QuickNode offers a custom-tailored solution. This package includes advanced analytics, priority support, and guaranteed uptime. The personalized nature of this solution means businesses can focus on building their products rather than worrying about node management.\n\n**Icy Tools - NFT Development**\n\nIcy Tools, QuickNode's next pillar, offers unique utilities for NFT development. As the NFT market has exploded, the demand for tools to streamline the creation, management, and trading of NFTs has grown exponentially. QuickNode's Icy Tools provide developers with an efficient and intuitive way to tap into this burgeoning market, thereby driving significant revenue for the company.\n\n**App Marketplace**\n\nQuickNode's App Marketplace is another key revenue stream. It hosts a wide range of applications built on QuickNode's infrastructure, providing a platform for other businesses and developers to sell their products. QuickNode, in turn, earns revenue through commissions and listing fees. This marketplace not only adds a vibrant ecosystem to QuickNode's offering but also acts as a value-added service for their node management customers.\n\n**Network Integration Fees**\n\nLastly, QuickNode also derives revenue from Network Integration fees. Given the ever-expanding landscape of blockchain protocols, integrating new networks is a continuous process. QuickNode charges businesses and developers a fee for this service, providing them with seamless access to emerging protocols.\n\nEach of these pillars plays a crucial role in QuickNode's revenue model, leveraging different aspects of the blockchain landscape to ensure the company's sustained financial health. Their diversified income sources have helped them remain resilient and adaptable, ready to face the dynamic challenges of the industry.\n\n<div style={{ display: \"flex\", width: \"100%\", justifyContent: \"center\" }}>\n  <iframe\n    src=\"https://blockedenxyz.substack.com/embed\"\n    width=\"480\"\n    height=\"320\"\n    frameborder=\"0\"\n    scrolling=\"no\"\n  ></iframe>\n</div>\n\n\n## High-speed growth of the business\n\nQuickNode has shown robust growth metrics that underscore its escalating position in the market. In 2022 alone, the firm witnessed a more than 40% quarterly uptick in enterprise revenue, demonstrating a sustained demand for its offerings.\n\nPlatform usage, a key indicator of product adoption, scaled 550% times over the past year. Reflecting a strong bottom line, gross revenue also spiked, showcasing a 370% YoY growth.\n\nFurther indicating QuickNode's expanding user base, new account registrations jumped by 177% YoY. Additionally, there was a massive 264% YoY surge in endpoints deployment, proving the company's increasing operational scale and efficiency.\n\n## The Competitive Landscape - Where the Rubber Meets the Road\n\nNow, let's delve into the crux of the matter. While QuickNode leads the pack in the node creation/connection market, it’s not without competition. Rivals like Amazon, Microsoft's Azure, and IBM are eyeing the space, posing potential threats to QuickNode's dominance. However, QuickNode has managed to hold its ground, primarily due to its industry-leading speed and flexibility, earning it rave reviews from customers. But is that enough to keep it ahead in this high-stakes game?\n\n**The Alchemy Conundrum**\n\nAlchemy, with its Silicon Valley roots and robust investor backing, is an intriguing contender. While it brings a lot to the table, it's not quite up to par with QuickNode when it comes to speed and offering. Yet, Alchemy's Silicon Valley connection and buzz could play a role in the ongoing battle of the nodes. It raised at 10.2B valuation on the market top reflected in their valuation and revenue multiple, which is rumored to be 120x - 200x.\n\n**Infura - The Fallen Star**\n\nInfura entered the arena as a trailblazer, focusing on Ethereum node RPC. However, post-acquisition by ConsenSys, it seems to have lost momentum. Although Infura supports six chains, its speed is trailing behind QuickNode's.\n\n**Coinbase Cloud - The Dark Horse**\n\nAcquiring Bison Trails puts Coinbase Cloud on the map, but rumors suggest Coinbase is dissatisfied with the outcome. Although the product relaunched with support for 25 chains, only Ethereum is currently in general availability. Moreover, its lack of public speed data keeps it shrouded in mystery.\n\n**BlockDaemon - A Specialized Contender**\n\nBlockDaemon distinguishes itself by specializing in an area - institutional-grade staking - that's rather different from QuickNode's primary focus, and hence it's not seen as developer friendly.\n\n## Is QuickNode falling short?\n\nNot exactly. It's more about the vast ocean of opportunities that its rivals could sail into. It's like saying, no team can win every time, even if they've got the best players. This space is big enough for many to play, each with their unique tactics. And let's not forget - blockchain is all about spreading the power, not hoarding it. So, no one player can rule the roost.\n\n## The Team Behind QuickNode - The Brains of the Operation\n\nThe QuickNode team, with its previous experience in managing hosting and CDN scaling businesses, brings a wealth of relevant skill sets to the table. Yet, we can't dismiss the fact that their competitors also come with their unique strengths, networks, and experiences.\n\n## BlockEden.xyz vs. QuickNode\n\nBlockEden.xyz follows the strategies below to effectively compete with QuickNode.\n\n1. **Differentiate on Unique Services:** First, BlockEden.xyz can offer unique APIs or blockchain services that QuickNode does not provide, like Aptos and its indexer, Sui and its indexer. By identifying gaps in QuickNode's offerings and stepping in to fill those gaps, BlockEden.xyz presents itself as a unique, comprehensive solution.\n2. **Competitive Pricing:** Another way to compete is through pricing. BlockEden.xyz offers more competitive pricing models that are more affordable for smaller businesses or developers. A flexible, scalable pricing model can attract a wider range of customers, from startups to enterprise-level organizations.\n3. **Superior Customer Service:** Providing superior customer service and technical support is another great way to compete. Quick response times, helpful resources, and knowledgeable support staff make all the difference when it comes to customer satisfaction and loyalty.\n4. **Partnerships and Integrations:** BlockEden.xyz seeks partnerships with other blockchain platforms or services, creating integrations that make it more appealing to customers. These partnerships can expand BlockEden's reach and functionality.\n5. **Community Engagement and Developer Support:** QuickNode has a strong developer community. BlockEden.xyz could compete by fostering a similar community and a developer DAO 10x.pub, providing strong support, and cultivating an ecosystem of developers and users who can contribute to and improve the platform.\n\nOur key to successful competition is not necessarily to beat QuickNode at its own game, but to provide unique value that QuickNode does not. We are finding the niche where BlockEden.xyz can excel, and focus on serving that market exceptionally well.\n\n\n- Twitter: https://twitter.com/BlockEdenHQ\n- Discord: https://discord.gg/4Yfvs2HWey\n- Source Link: https://blockeden.xyz/blog/2023/07/09/quicknode/\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn the fast-paced world of blockchain, QuickNode indeed stands out.
