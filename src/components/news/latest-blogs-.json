    "content": "> **ðŸ’µ TL;DR**\n>\n> 1. We've increased the rate limit by 5x for all plans.\n> 2. For improved granularity, 1 CU has been updated to 100 CU.\n> 3. Announcing our new \"Basic\" plan priced at $19.99.\n> 4. CUs are now denominated in CUC and are refreshed daily. Monitor your balance at [blockeden.xyz/dash/account](blockeden.xyz/dash/account).\n> 5. With our updated plans, extra CUCs beyond those plans allow you to access extra API calls using a pay-as-you-go system every day.\n\n\n\nBlockEden.xyz is committed to providing cost-effective and efficient solutions to indie developers, small businesses, and venture-backed companies. Our customer feedback revealed a few key insights:\n\n1. A requirement for an intermediate tier between the Free and Pro plans.\n2. A desire for a more flexible 'pay-as-you-go' option.\n3. An opportunity for us to accommodate more requests through a more efficient infrastructure.\n\nBased on these insights, we're excited to announce the introduction of a pay-as-you-go feature using Compute Unit Credit (CUC), and to share details about modifications to our pricing plans.\n\n## **Understanding Compute Units and Compute Unit Credit**\n\nA **Compute Unit** (CU) serves as a standard measurement that quantifies the computational expense incurred during an API call. It's akin to how AWS charges for compute usage. The computational cost varies depending on the intensity of the queries â€“ some are lightweight and fast (e.g., eth_blockNumber) while others can be more demanding (e.g., large eth_getLogs queries). The cost in CU for each request across different products can be found in our[ API marketplace](https://blockeden.xyz/api-marketplace).\n\n**Compute Unit Credits** (CUC) are like credit card rewards on our platform to serve as royalty points. Those points are identical to compute units. Developers could spend CUC on our platform to get extra quotas for API calls.\n\n## **Implementing Pay-As-You-Go with CUC**\n\nWe'll set up a reward account for each customer. Customers can load this account with CUC, which will then be consumed as per their API usage.\n\n- For the Free tier, we ensure a minimum balance of 0.3 CUC at the start of each month.\n- For the paid tiers (Basic, Pro, Enterprise 50), we will credit the account on each subscription or renewal.\n\nWe do not allow customer to withdraw CUC for now.\n\nThe credits on BlockEden.xyz will be reconciled daily and also each time a withdrawal or deposit is made. **BlockEden.xyz maintains the rights to the Compute Units (CU) on our platform, along with the authority to clarify the application of the API and the usage of credits**.\n\n## **Pricing Plan Modifications**\n\nBelow are the changes to our pricing plans. The original pricing structure was as follows:\n\n|                    | **Free**    | **Pro**   | **Enterprise 50** | **Enterprise 500** |\n| ------------------ | ----------- | --------- | ----------------- | ------------------ |\n| Price              | 0           | 49.99     | 200               | 1999               |\n| CU / day           | 0.1 Million | 1 Million | 4.32 Million      | 50 Million         |\n| Price / Million CU | 0           | 1.66      | 1.54              | 1.33               |\n| Ratelimit req/s    | 1           | 10        | 50                | 500                |\n| Project allowed    | 15          | 30        | 100               | 300                |\n\nIn response to customer feedback, we've made the following adjustments:\n\n1. The \"Enterprise 500\" tier has been discontinued, and a \"Basic\" tier has been introduced to offer indie developers more flexibility.\n2. Rate limits have been increased five-fold for almost all plans.\n\nHere is our updated pricing structure:\n\n| **Plan**           | **Free**   | **Basic**  | **Pro**     | **Enterprise 50** |\n| ------------------ | ---------- | ---------- | ----------- | ----------------- |\n| Price              | 0          | 19.99      | 49.99       | 199.99            |\n| CU / day           | 10 Million | 40 Million | 100 Million | 513.33 Million    |\n| Price / Million CU | 0          | 0.0167     | 0.0167      | 0.0130            |\n| Ratelimit CU/s     | 1,000      | 10,000     | 10,000      | 500,000           |\n| Ratelimit req/s    | 5          | 50         | 50          | 250               |\n| Project allowed    | 15         | 30         | 100         | 300               |\n\n## **Why Choose BlockEden.xyz**\n\nBlockEden.xyz is a comprehensive API marketplace that powers DApps for a variety of blockchain ecosystems.

    "content": "In the evolving landscape of Web3, a new approach to user interactions is emerging â€“ the intent-centric protocol. Here, users simply **express what they want**, leaving the intricate process of how it's achieved to the system. This approach heralds enhanced user experience, better composability, and greater privacy.\n\n### The Three Pillars of Intent-Centricity\n\n1. **User-Centric Interaction**: The essence of intent-centricity lies in streamlining user experience. By emphasizing the \"what\" over the \"how,\" it spares users the need to grapple with complex underlying mechanisms. The result? A straightforward expression of their objectives.\n\n2. **Robust Composability**: In the realm of Web3, composability denotes the ease with which various protocols or apps integrate and build upon each other. When users solely voice their intent, it provides room for systems to be tailored for maximized compatibility, fostering richer and more cohesive digital ecosystems.\n\n3. **Privacy by Design**: Expressing just the intent can obviate the need for users to disclose detailed or sensitive data about themselves. This is a major stride towards ensuring user privacy in blockchain interactions.\n\n### Let's Paint a Picture\n\nConsider Alice â€“ a newcomer to the DeFi (Decentralized Finance) world with minimal technical expertise. She's just dipped her toes into the realm of cryptocurrency and is curious about staking to earn interest.\n\n| **Traditional Protocol** | **Intent-Centric Protocol** |\n|--------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| 1. Alice starts by selecting a staking platform.<br/>2. She grapples with its intricacies.<br/>3. She's faced with choices: locked staking or flexible?<br/>4. Next, she must comprehend the risks linked to her choice.<br/>5. Finally, after a labyrinthine process, she stakes her cryptocurrency. | 1. Alice accesses a Web3 app.<br/>2. She straightforwardly states: \"I wish to stake X crypto and earn interest.\"<br/>3. The protocol, cognizant of her intent, optimizes the staking method for her â€“ considering market dynamics, her stake, and more.<br/>4. Behind the scenes, it liaises with the required DeFi protocols, managing the technicalities.<br/>5. Alice gets an affirmation: her cryptocurrency is staked and interest earnings are on the way. |\n\nFor Alice, the intent-centric approach is a breath of fresh air. Sheâ€™s spared the technical maze and instead, expresses her intent. The protocol does the heavy lifting, ensuring her privacy and sourcing the best available options.\n\n### What Fuels the Rise of Intent-Centricity?\n\nThe rising wave of intent-centricity is spurred by a blend of the AIGC revolution, developments like EIP4337 (smart contract accounts), and the push to make Web3 accessible to all.\n\nA testament to this trend is the project showcased at ETHGlobal Paris 2023: [**Bob the Solver** - Pioneering infrastructure for intent-based transactions to elevate the UX of wallets and dapps](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/bob-the-solver-yxtgp).\n\n![Bob the solver](https://tp-misc.b-cdn.net/blockeden/Bob-the-Solver.png \"Bob the solver\")\n\n## Summary\n\nAs the digital realm advances, user-centric approaches like intent-centric protocols are shaping the future of Web3 interactions. By shifting the focus from intricate processes to straightforward intent expression, these protocols are democratizing access, enhancing user experience, and promoting privacy. With innovations such as Bob the Solver leading the charge, the Web3 space is poised to become more inclusive and user-friendly, bridging the gap between the technical and the everyday user. Embracing intent-centricity is not just the next step; it's the future of decentralized digital interactions.\n\n\n- Twitter: https://twitter.com/BlockEdenHQ\n- Discord: https://discord.gg/4Yfvs2HWey\n- Source Link: https://blockeden.xyz/blog/2023/08/30/embracing-intent-centric-protocols-web3-revolution/"
