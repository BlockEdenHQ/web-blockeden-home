    "content": "The Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act (H.R. 5045), introduced by Representatives Emmer and Soto on August 17, 2021, marks a pivotal advancement for blockchain technology. This legislation seeks to carve out a safe harbor for blockchain developers and service providers who do not control digital currencies, shielding them from the licensing and registration mandates typically reserved for financial institutions.\n\n#### Core Elements of the Act:\n\n- **Safe Harbor Provision**: Targets blockchain entities without control over digital currencies, exempting them from being classified as money transmitters or financial institutions, thus freeing them from burdensome regulatory requirements.\n- **Intellectual Property and State Law Respect**: Maintains the act's non-interference with intellectual property laws and upholds the ability of states to enforce compatible regulations.\n- **Clear Definitions**: Establishes precise definitions for \"blockchain network,\" \"developer,\" \"service,\" \"control,\" and \"digital currency,\" clarifying the act's scope and applicability.\n\n#### Impact on the Blockchain Sector:\n\nThe act is a significant stride towards regulatory clarity for the blockchain industry, fostering an environment conducive to innovation while ensuring necessary consumer protections. By delineating non-controlling from controlling entities, it focuses regulatory efforts where they're most needed, promoting a secure and flourishing blockchain ecosystem.\n\n#### Forward Look:\n\nThe Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act represents a critical step in acknowledging and supporting blockchain technology's growth within a suitable regulatory framework. It's a move towards empowering innovation in the blockchain space, setting a precedent for future legislative efforts in this rapidly evolving field."

    "content": "We are excited to share that BlockEden.xyz is joining hands with Stellar, in order to empower developers worldwide. Stellar's blockchain platform has been a game-changer in quick and affordable cross-border transactions, while BlockEden.xyz's reliable API offerings for diverse DApps have positioned us as a key player across multiple blockchains. Together, we are poised to inspire a dynamic shift in the realms of blockchain and global finance.\n\n<img className=\"border\" src=\"https://tp-misc.b-cdn.net/blockeden/soroban-data-analytics.png\"/>\n\n## **What is Stellar**\n\nStellar is an open-source, decentralized blockchain network designed to facilitate swift, low-cost cross-border transactions. Introduced in 2014 by Jed McCaleb, co-founder of Ripple and eDonkey, the Stellar network operates on a unique consensus protocol rather than the traditional proof-of-work or proof-of-stake mechanisms. People use Stellar network to build applications, issue assets, and build anchors (currency converters).\n\n### Stellar Soroban\n\nSoroban is a smart contract platform that is integrated into the existing Stellar blockchain. Developers could develop smart contracts with a Rust dialect and interact with Stellar’s accounts and assets, not other operations like SDEX, AMMs, Claimable Balances, or Sponsorships.\n\nThe Soroban mainnet upgrade is scheduled for February 20th .\n\n## **What is BlockEden.xyz**\n\nBlockEden.xyz is an API marketplace powering DApps of all sizes for Sui, Aptos, Solana, and 12 EVM blockchains. Why do our customers choose us?\n\n1. High availability. We maintain 99.9% uptime since our first API - Aptos main net launch.\n2. Inclusive API offerings and community. Our services have expanded to include Sui, Ethereum, IoTeX, Solana, Polygon, Polygon zkEVM, Filecoin, Harmony, BSC, Arbitrum, Optimism, Gnosis, Arbitrum Nova & EthStorage Galileo. Our community 10x.pub has 4000+ web3 innovators from Silicon Valley, Seattle, and NYC.\n3. Security. With over $45 million worth of tokens staked with us, our clients trust us to provide reliable and secure solutions for their web3 and blockchain needs.\n\nWe provide a comprehensive suite of services designed to empower every participant in the blockchain space, focusing on three key areas:\n\n- For blockchain **protocol builders**, we ensure robust security and decentralization by operating nodes and making long-term ecosystem contributions.\n- For **DApp developers**, we build user-friendly APIs to streamline development and unleash the full potential of decentralized applications.\n- For **token holders**, we offer a reliable staking service to maximize rewards and optimize asset management.\n\n## **What is** **BlockEden.xyz building on Stellar and what** **does this mean for developers?**\n\nBlockEden.xyz is leveraging the Stellar network to offer commercial Soroban RPC and indexed data to help DApp developers to speed up development with a GraphQL API and analytics.\n\nThis comprehensive expansion into Stellar's infrastructure is set to present developers with more resources and tools, potentially facilitating easier adoption and more robust application development within the Stellar blockchain ecosystem.\n\n**Node operator and Indexer for Soroban RPC and Indexer GraphQL**\n\nAs a node operator, BlockEden.xyz runs Soroban RPC, and then provides commercial standard RPCs to developers on the left. Unlike the official endpoints, our RPCs are equipped with rate limits and API meters tailored to developers’ tiered needs.\n\nBlockEden.xyz also builds an indexer for contract data, tokens, events, etc. in the Soroban smart contract platform.\n\n<img className=\"border\" src=\"https://tp-misc.b-cdn.net/blockeden/soroban-how-indexer-works.png\"/>\n\nThe index data will serve as [GraphQL](https://blockeden.xyz/api-marketplace/stellar-soroban-indexer). The exact content of the index data is to be decided, though we will expose at least the developer-facing data models of the Horizon service.\n\n<img className=\"border\" src=\"https://tp-misc.b-cdn.net/blockeden/soroban-indexer-01_99.webp\"/>\n\n**Business Intelligence / Analytics**\n\n<img className=\"border\" src=\"https://tp-misc.b-cdn.net/blockeden/soroban-mainnet-analytics.webp\"/>\n\n\n**Soroban RPC**\n\nFor developer's convenience, we also serve [the standard JSON RPC](https://blockeden.xyz/api-marketplace/stellar-soroban).\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nIn conclusion, as we pave the way towards a new era in blockchain and global finance, our partnership with Stellar represents a significant milestone. Harnessing Stellar's swift, cost-effective transaction capabilities and BlockEden.xyz's high-quality API offerings, we are poised to create a paradigm shift in the way developers engage with the open money network. We hope this work will inspire innovations, trigger advancements, and propel us all towards a more connected and decentralized world. Here's to a future filled with endless possibilities and shared successes."
