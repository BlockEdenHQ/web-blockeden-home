# BlockEden.xyz Refund Policy

## 1. Overview

At BlockEden.xyz, we strive to provide high-quality API services for blockchain developers. This Refund Policy outlines the terms and conditions under which we may issue refunds for our services.

## 2. Eligible Refunds

If our services experience significant downtime that fails to meet our advertised 99.9% uptime guarantee, you may be eligible for a pro-rated refund based on the duration and severity of the outage.

### 2.2 Subscription Cancellations

- **Monthly Subscriptions**: No refunds are provided for partial months. When you cancel a monthly subscription, you will maintain access to our services until the end of your current billing period.
- **Annual Subscriptions**: If you cancel an annual subscription within the first 14 days of purchase and have not exceeded 10% of your allocated Compute Unit Credits (CUC), you may be eligible for a refund minus a 15% administrative fee.

Pre-paid CUC are non-refundable once purchased. However, they do not expire and remain available for future use.
