# Compute Unit

**Compute unit** is an uniformed measure to tell how expensive an API invocation
is. BlockeEden.xyz provides multiple types of services, and support mutiple
networks. The machine cost to support each other is different. Therefore, we
need to use compute unit to report the API invocation price in a comparable way.

Service Pricing

| Service       | Network | Compute Unit(s) |
|---------------|---------|-----------------|
| Node API      | Aptos   | 1               |
| Node API      | Sui     | 1               |
| GraphQL API   | Aptos   | 5               |
| Analytics SQL | Aptos   | 100             |

Note: the machine cost of providing these services could be changed over the
time. We resere the right of adjusting the compute units of eacch service and
network in the future.
