## Make a request with Block Eden

The access URL is your unique endpoint to use Sui node API. Copy it and
compose the first request:
```
# sui json-rpc discover request

curl -X POST https://sui-devnet.blockeden.xyz/<access_key>
-H 'Content-Type: application/json'
-d '{ "jsonrpc":"2.0", "method":"rpc.discover","id":1}'
```

```
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "result": {
        "openrpc": "1.2.6",
        "info": {
            ......
```
If you see a response like the above, you're all set.
