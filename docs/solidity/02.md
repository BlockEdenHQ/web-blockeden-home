# Solidity Syntax - Version, Import, Types, Control Structures

Solidity is a contract-oriented programming language used for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. In this tutorial, we will discuss the syntax of Solidity.

## **Version Pragma**

Version pragma specifies the version of the compiler that should be used to compile the contract. It is recommended to use the latest version available.

Example:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.5.2;
```

The above code will compile with a compiler version >= 0.5.2 and < 0.6.0.

## **Import Files**

Import statements allow us to use code from other Solidity files. There are three types of import statements:

1. Import all symbols from a file:

```solidity
import "filename"
```

2. Import all symbols from a file and assign a symbol to the file:

```solidity
import * as symbolName from "filename";
```

or

```solidity
import "filename" as symbolName;
```

3. Import only selected symbols from a file:

```solidity
import {symbol1 as alias, symbol2} from "filename";
```

## **Types**

Solidity supports several data types, which include:

### **Boolean**

The **`bool`** type in Solidity can have the values **`true`** or **`false`**.

Operators:

- Logical: **`!`** (logical negation), **`&&`** (AND), **`||`** (OR)
- Comparisons: **`==`** (equality), **`!=`** (inequality)

Example:

```solidity
bool x = true;
bool y = false;
```

### **Integer**

Solidity supports both unsigned and signed integers.

Unsigned: **`uint8`**, **`uint16`**, **`uint32`**, **`uint64`**, **`uint128`**, **`uint256`**.

Signed: **`int8`**, **`int16`**, **`int32`**, **`int64`**, **`int128`**, **`int256`**.

Operators:

- Comparisons: **`<=`**, **`<`**, **`==`**, **`!=`**, **`>=`** and **`>`**
- Bit operators: **`&`**, **`|`**, **`^`** (bitwise exclusive or) and **`~`** (bitwise negation)
- Arithmetic operators: **`+`**, **``**, unary **``**, unary **`+`**, **``**, **`/`**, **`%`**, **`*`** (exponentiation), **`<<`** (left shift) and **`>>`** (right shift)

Example:

```solidity
uint256 a = 10;
int256 b = -20;
```

### **Address**

The **`address`** type in Solidity holds an Ethereum address (20-byte value).

The **`address payable`** type is similar to **`address`** but includes additional methods **`transfer`** and **`send`**.

Operators:

- Comparisons: **`<=`**, **`<`**, **`==`**, **`!=`**, **`>=`** and **`>`**

Methods:

- **`balance`**: **`address.balance`** returns the balance of the address in Wei.
- **`transfer`**: **`address.transfer(amount)`** sends the given amount of Wei to the address and throws on failure.
- **`send`**: **`address.send(amount) returns (bool)`** sends the given amount of Wei to the address and returns **`false`** on failure.
- **`call`**: **`address.call(...)`** issues a low-level **`CALL`** and returns **`false`** on failure.
- **`delegatecall`**: **`address.delegatecall(...)`** issues a low-level **`DELEGATECALL`** and returns **`false`** on failure.

Example:

```solidity
address payable x = address(0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890);
```

### **Array**

Solidity supports both dynamic and fixed-sized arrays.

Example:

```solidity
uint[] dynamicSizeArray;
uint[7] fixedSizeArray;
```

### **Fixed Byte Arrays**

Fixed byte arrays are declared using the syntax **`bytesI`**, where I is an integer between 1 and 32, inclusive. They are used to store binary data of a fixed length. The byte array can be accessed using its index, which starts from 0.

```solidity
bytes1 myByte;
bytes32 myBytes;

myByte[0] = 0x12;
myBytes[31] = 0xff;
```

### **Dynamic Byte Arrays**

Dynamic byte arrays are declared using the **`bytes`** keyword. They are used to store binary data of a variable length. The byte array can be accessed using its index, which starts from 0. It is similar to the **`byte[]`** type.

```solidity
bytes myBytes;
myBytes.push(0x12);
myBytes.push(0xff);
```

### **Enum**

An enum is a custom data type that allows a developer to define a set of named values. It is declared using the **`enum`** keyword followed by the name of the enum and the values.

```solidity
enum ActionChoices {
  GoLeft,
  GoRight,
  GoStraight,
  SitStill
}

ActionChoices choice = ActionChoices.GoStraight;
```

### **Struct**

A struct is a user-defined data type that groups together variables of different data types. It is declared using the **`struct`** keyword, followed by the name of the struct and the variables.

```solidity
struct Funder {
    address addr;
    uint amount;
}

Funder funders;
funders.addr = 0x123;
funders.amount = 1000;
```

### **Mapping**

A mapping is a data structure that maps a key to a value. It is declared using the **`mapping`** keyword, followed by the data type of the key and the data type of the value.

```solidity
mapping(address => uint) balances;

balances[0x123] = 1000;
```

## **Control Structures**

Solidity supports most of the control structures from JavaScript, such as **`if`**, **`else`**, **`while`**, **`do`**, **`for`**, **`break`**, **`continue`**, **`return`**, and the ternary operator **`?:`**. However, the **`switch`** and **`goto`** statements are not supported.

```solidity
if (x > 10) {
  // do something
} else {
  // do something else
}

while (i < 10) {
  // do something
  i++;
}

for (uint i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  // do something
}

return 42;
```
