# Solidity Syntax - Using For, Error Handling, Global Variables

In this tutorial, we will cover Solidity syntax, specifically on using the **`using - for`** keyword, error handling, global variables, mathematical and cryptographic functions, and contract-related keywords.

## **Using - For**

The **`using A for B;`** syntax in Solidity can be used to attach library functions to any type. For example, the following code attaches a library function called **`add`** from the **`arithmatic`** library to the **`uint`** type:

```solidity
library arithmatic {
    function add(uint _a, uint _b) returns (uint) {
        return _a + _b;
    }
}

contract C {
    using arithmatic for uint;

    uint sum;
    function f(uint _a) {
        sum = _a.add(3);
    }
}
```

In the above code, the library **`arithmatic`** contains a function called **`add`** that takes two **`uint`** arguments and returns their sum. We then use the **`using arithmatic for uint`** syntax to attach the **`add`** function to the **`uint`** type. This allows us to call the **`add`** function on any **`uint`** variable, as shown in the **`f`** function.

## **Error Handling**

Solidity provides three functions for error handling: **`assert`**, **`require`**, and **`revert`**.

- **`assert(bool condition)`**: throws if the condition is not met. This function is used for internal errors that should never occur, and its failure indicates a bug in the code.
- **`require(bool condition)`**: throws if the condition is not met. This function is used for errors in inputs or external components.
- **`revert()`**: abort execution and revert state changes. This function is used to explicitly trigger a revert without any error message.

```solidity
function sendHalf(address addr) payable returns (uint balance) {
    require(msg.value % 2 == 0); // Only allow even numbers
    uint balanceBeforeTransfer = this.balance;
    addr.transfer(msg.value / 2);
    assert(this.balance == balanceBeforeTransfer - msg.value / 2);
    return this.balance;
}
```

In the above code, the **`require`** function checks that the **`msg.value`** is an even number. If it is not, the function will throw an error and the transaction will be reverted. The **`assert`** function checks that the balance of the contract before and after the transfer is as expected. If it is not, the function will throw an error and the transaction will be reverted.

## **Global Variables**

Solidity provides several global variables that can be used in smart contract development. These include block variables and transaction variables.

### **Block Variables**

- **`block.blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32)`**: hash of the given block - only works for the 256 most recent blocks excluding current
- **`block.coinbase (address)`**: current block miner’s address
- **`block.difficulty (uint)`**: current block difficulty
- **`block.gaslimit (uint)`**: current block gaslimit
- **`block.number (uint)`**: current block number
- **`block.timestamp (uint)`**: current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch
- **`now (uint)`**: current block timestamp (alias for **`block.timestamp`**)

### **Transaction Variables**

- **`msg.data (bytes)`**: complete calldata
- **`msg.gas (uint)`**: remaining gas
- **`msg.sender (address)`**: sender of the message (current call)
- **`msg.sig (bytes4)`**: first four bytes of the calldata (i.e. function identifier)
- **`msg.value (uint)`**: number of wei sent with the message
- **`tx.gasprice (uint)`**: gas price of the transaction
- **`tx.origin (address)`**: sender of the transaction (full call chain)

## **Mathematical and Cryptographic Functions**

Solidity provides several built-in mathematical and cryptographic functions that can be used in smart contract development. Some of these functions include:

- **`addmod(uint x, uint y, uint k) returns (uint)`**: compute (x + y) % k where the addition is performed with arbitrary precision and does not wrap around at 2^256.
- **`mulmod(uint x, uint y, uint k) returns (uint)`**: compute (x \* y) % k where the multiplication is performed with arbitrary precision and does not wrap around at 2^256.
- **`keccak256(...) returns (bytes32)`**: compute the Ethereum-SHA-3 (Keccak-256) hash of the (tightly packed) arguments.
- **`sha256(...) returns (bytes32)`**: compute the SHA-256 hash of the (tightly packed) arguments.
- **`sha3(...) returns (bytes32)`**: alias to keccak256.
- **`ripemd160(...) returns (bytes20)`**: compute RIPEMD-160 hash of the (tightly packed) arguments.
- **`ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address)`**: recover the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error (example usage).

## **Contract Related**

Solidity also provides several keywords that are related to contracts.

- **`this (current contract’s type)`**: the current contract, explicitly convertible to Address.
- **`selfdestruct(address recipient)`**: destroy the current contract, sending its funds to the given Address.
- **`suicide(address recipient)`**: alias to selfdestruct. Soon to be deprecated.

In this tutorial, we have covered Solidity syntax, including using the **`using - for`** keyword, error handling, global variables, mathematical and cryptographic functions, and contract-related keywords. Solidity provides a powerful set of tools for building smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.
