### Why is Delegated Staking Infra Important to BlockEden.xyz?

* It’s the revenue-generating program, bringing resources to do more strategic infra work.
* It’s an essential infra component to serve chain RPCs, particularly for latency-sensitive use cases.

### How Can Delegated Staking Infra Fail? Would it Cause Customer Dislikes?

* Failures in delegated staking infrastructure primarily occur due to service disruptions and server downtime. These issues can prevent customers from staking tokens or lead to reduced rewards due to slashing penalties. Such disruptions often result in customer dissatisfaction due to unmet expectations of consistent earnings and reliable service.

### What are the Dependencies?

* Network Selection: The chosen blockchain network plays a critical role. Different networks may have varying protocols, reward structures, and security requirements.
* Initial Funding: To participate as a validator in the staking process, an initial investment or fund is required. This amount varies depending on the network's criteria and serves as your stake in the network.

### What are the Risks?

* Fund Safety: Ideally, we should make a product that doesn’t bear the liability for the customer's fund. However, it largely depends on the blockchain's features, e.g., isolation of token owner and node operator permission.
* Crypto Market Volatility: In a sudden crypto price crash or bearish market, the token rewards might be short to cover the machine cost. A liquidation plan should be in place to ensure funds are secured to operate the infra.
