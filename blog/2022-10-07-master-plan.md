Block Eden aims to build an all-inclusive platform for web3 developers in the
next 5 years. The strategy is to start with a genesis product that could solve
some client business needs immediately. We identify Aptos chain API service as
such a genesis product. If we’re doing well, we are able to grow our product
offering horizontally, vertically and scalably given more resources, more
experiences and a stronger reputation.

### Horizontally
- Being the primary platform in Aptos ecosystem.
- Being the primary platform in Move VM ecosystem (including Sui, Linera).
- Being the primary platform for other public blockchains (e.g., EVM-based ecosystem, Polkadot ecosystem, Cosmos ecosystem).

### Vertically
- Providing native Chain API.
- Providing enhanced API (e.g., Coin, Token, NFT Marketplaces, DeFi protocols).
- Real-time notification and webhook.
- Data analytics.
- Client SDK.

### Scalably
- Single data center,  ~10K QPS, ~100TiB data volume
- Multi data centers, ~1M QPS, 10PiB data volume
- Planet scale
