We are on a mission to build and accelerate the web3 industry of tomorrow. We obsess about developer experience and strive towards constant innovation. And that's why now we are offering a decentralized file store, powered by EthStorage. dStore is a managed storage solution for creators and developers from any blockchain. It's user-friendly, EVM-compatible, low-cost, and petabyte-level scale, all powered by EthStorage.

## What is EthStorage?

EthStorage is a layer 2 solution that provides programmable dynamic storage based on Ethereum's data availability. It will greatly reduce the storage cost of storing a large amount of data on Ethereum, saving the cost from 1% to 0.1%. The low cost of storing large data by EthStorage can better enable a fully decentralized network in the future. EthStorage is highly integrated with EVM and is compatible with Solidity, Remix, Hardhat, and MetaMask. The team received a research grant from the Ethereum Foundation for data availability research.

EthStorage is invented by Dr. Qi Zhou, the founder of QuarkChain and author of EIP-4804/4972/5018/5027/5478. You can track EthStorage's statuses from the following sources:

## Why does decentralized storage matter?

Decentralized storage is important because it allows for data to be stored in a distributed manner rather than being stored in a single location. This has several advantages, such as increased security and reliability, as well as improved accessibility. For example, because decentralized storage systems are distributed, they are less vulnerable to attacks, censorship, or failure and can continue to function even if some of the individual components fail. Additionally, because the data is stored on multiple devices, it can be accessed from multiple locations, making it more convenient for users.

## What is BlockEden. xyz's dStore offering?

We strongly believe Dr. Zhou's vision to bring more cost-effective storage to the decentralized web and would like to collaborate with his team to democratize this innovation to every web3 developer on the planet.

More specifically, we will apply EthStorage as the underlying vendor of our blob store. Our developers can develop upon it to build their DApps faster and scale instantly.

**Web portal for file management**

Developers and creators can drag and drop their static assets to this file store and easily manage them. We free them from the hassles of managing private keys, paying transaction fees, and maintaining files with blockchains.

To ensure the decentralization of the storage, developers could eject the managed store to their own address anytime. Furthermore, we will open source the backend of the file store so that developers or other developer-facing providers can easily host file management services.

## Unlocking new business possibilities through strategic partnerships

There are also future integration opportunities between EthStorage and BlockEden.xyz, in addition to the dStore launched today.

**CDN to speed up the read**

Most Internet services are read-intensive and take time to serve a large number of resources from a decentralized store. With our CDN service, developers can enjoy both the decentralization of the source files and the blazing-fast speed that we can achieve with a CDN.

**Node service and API gateway to EthStorage**

We will provide API access to EthStorage testnet and mainnet blockchain nodes after EthStorage mainnet launch for developers and businesses. Here are a few reasons why developers should choose us instead of their own or the official nodes:

1. Easy Access to blockchain Nodes: BlockEden.xyz ChainPlus API provides easy access to EthStorage nodes, which can be used to interact with these blockchain networks. Starts to build in 10s, instead of spending 20 hours to start, countless hours to maintain!

2. Scalability: BlockEden.xyz provides highly scalable nodes that can handle high levels of traffic and transactions. This can be important for businesses and projects requiring large amounts of data or user activity.

3. Reliability: BlockEden.xyz nodes are highly reliable, with an uptime of 99.9%. This can be important for businesses and projects that need to ensure that their applications or services are always available to users.

## How to use dStore with EthStorage?

**Step 1**. Go to https://BlockEden.xyz/dash/dstore and then drag and drop your files to the window.

**Step 2**. After the file is uploaded to the EthStorage successfully, you will see the item in the table, then right-click the row and select "Copy URL" to get the link. You can also delete a file by selecting "Delete".

Admittedly, the current version of dStore has some limitations. We don't support uploading directories and large files (size > 2MB). It may take tens of seconds to upload mid-sized images. However, this is just an initial version, and we will keep improving the product in the long run.

Dr. Qi Zhou, founder of EthStorage, share his praise on twitter -

<blockquote className="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Introducing dStore <a href="https://twitter.com/BlockEdenHQ?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@BlockEdenHQ</a>! <br /><br />dStore makes it super easy for devs and creators to manage files on <a href="https://twitter.com/EthStorage?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@EthStorage</a> with web3:// protocol without their own keys. We expect to see more integrations from it and more early teams like the capable <a href="https://twitter.com/BlockEdenHQ?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@BlockEdenHQ</a> to build our ecosystem.</p>â€” Qi Zhou (@qc_qizhou) <a href="https://twitter.com/qc_qizhou/status/1627530354587488256?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 20, 2023</a></blockquote>

Mike Thrift, BD at BlockEden.xyz, commented, "dStore enriched our bundled offering to the creators and developers and laid a solid foundation for our aggregated function API services to blockchains. It made us an active contributor to the Ethereum ecosystem and gave our Aptos and Sui developers a more cost-effective and flexible choice than IPFS or Arweave."

BlockEden.xyz is committed to providing the best developer experiences to web3 developers, which does not limit to Blockchain RPCs. The decentralized storage opens new doors for developers to manage their NFT assets and files in our one-stop shop. Get started today for free at https://blockeden.xyz/dstore
