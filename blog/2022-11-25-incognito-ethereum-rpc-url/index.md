abstract: We opened a public and free Ethereum Mainnet RPC endpoint for Metamask clients who want to keep their transactions untracked.

Starting from **Sept 23, 2023**, if you use the default RPC URL (aka https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/) in **Metamask**, your IP address and wallet address will be collected whenever you send a transaction ([source](https://cointelegraph.com/news/metamask-will-start-collecting-user-ip-addresses)).

Some people prefer to keep their identity untracked, and are looking for an alternative RPC URL that doesn’t track user identity. Here **[BlockEden.xyz](https://blockeden.xyz)** gets you covered! We have opened a public Ethereum Mainnet RPC endpoint – **https://eth-mainnet-public.blockeden.xyz for free**, and we **do not** trace any user identity of any transactions going through our RPC URL as well as blockchain data reading operations.

To set it up with your Metamask, go to Settings -> Networks, and click “Add a network” on the upper right corner. You can fill in the following info:
- Network name: **Ethereum Mainnet (BlockEden.xyz)**
- New RPC URL: **https://eth-mainnet-public.blockeden.xyz**
- Chain ID: 1
- Currency symbol: ETH
- Block explorer URL: https://etherscan.io

Then, you’re good to go, and click “Save”. When you want to send an incognito transaction, you could just select “**Ethereum Mainnet (BlockEden.xyz)**” network, and then send the transaction (shhh~).
