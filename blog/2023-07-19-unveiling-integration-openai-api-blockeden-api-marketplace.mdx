We are glad to announce that BlockEden.xyz, web3 developers' go-to platform for API marketplace, has added a new, powerful capability â€“ OpenAI API. Yes, you heard it right! Developers, tech enthusiasts, and AI pioneers can now leverage the cutting-edge machine learning models offered by OpenAI, directly through BlockEden's API Marketplace.

Before we dive into the how-to guide, let's understand what OpenAI API brings to the table. OpenAI API is a gateway to AI models developed by OpenAI, such as the industry-renowned GPT-3, the state-of-the-art transformer-based language model known for its remarkable ability to understand and generate human-like text. The API enables developers to use this advanced technology for a variety of applications, including drafting emails, writing code, answering questions, creating written content, tutoring, language translation, and much more.

Now, let's see how you can incorporate the power of OpenAI API into your applications using BlockEden.xyz. You can do it in three ways: using Python, using JavaScript (Node.js), or using curl directly from the command line. In this blog, we're going to provide the basic setup for each method, using a simple "Hello, World!" example.

The API key below is public and subject to change and rate limit. Get your own `BLOCKEDEN_API_KEY` from https://blockeden.xyz/dash instead.

**Python**:

Using Python, you can use the OpenAI API as shown in the following snippet:

```python
import openai

BLOCKEDEN_API_KEY = "8UuXzatAZYDBJC6YZTKD"
openai.api_key = ""
openai.api_base = "https://api.blockeden.xyz/openai/" + BLOCKEDEN_API_KEY + "/v1"

response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
  model="gpt-3.5-turbo-16k",
  messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "hello, world!"}],
  temperature=0,
  max_tokens=2048,
  top_p=1,
  frequency_penalty=0,
  presence_penalty=0
)

print(response["choices"])
```

**JavaScript (Node.js)**:

You can also utilize the OpenAI API with JavaScript. Here's how you can do it:

```js
const { Configuration, OpenAIApi } = require("openai");

const BLOCKEDEN_API_KEY = "8UuXzatAZYDBJC6YZTKD";
const configuration = new Configuration({
  basePath: "https://api.blockeden.xyz/openai/" + BLOCKEDEN_API_KEY + "/v1"
});
const openai = new OpenAIApi(configuration);

(async () => {
  const response = await openai.createChatCompletion({
    model: "gpt-3.5-turbo-16k",
    messages: [{role: "user", content: "hello, world!"}],
    temperature: 0,
    max_tokens: 2048,
    top_p: 1,
    frequency_penalty: 0,
    presence_penalty: 0,
  });

  console.log(JSON.stringify(response.data.choices, null, 2));
})()
```

**cURL**:

Last but not least, you can call the OpenAI API using curl directly from your terminal:

```bash
curl https://api.blockeden.xyz/openai/8UuXzatAZYDBJC6YZTKD/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
  "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-16k",
  "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "hello, world!"}],
  "temperature": 0,
  "max_tokens": 2048,
  "top_p": 1,
  "frequency_penalty": 0,
  "presence_penalty": 0
}'
```

So, what's next? Dive in, experiment, and discover how you can leverage the power of OpenAI API for your projects, be it for chatbots, content generation, or any other NLP-based application. The possibilities are as vast as your imagination. With BlockEden.xyz's seamless integration with OpenAI, let's redefine the boundaries of what's possible.
