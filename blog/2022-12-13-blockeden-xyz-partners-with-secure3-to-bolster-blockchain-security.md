## What is Secure3?

Secure3 is a collaborative web3 security auditing ecosystem that helps organizations identify and fix vulnerabilities in their smart contracts. The company was founded in 2022 by a team of world-class security researchers and developers passionate about building a more secure web3 world.

Secure3's mission is to secure web3 by empowering a transparent, collaborative, and verifiable security ecosystem. To that end, they provide:

- Trustworthy security auditing for projects.
- A competitive incentive model for auditors and whitehats.
- Verifiable security track records for the community.

The new model finds more critical bugs faster than any centralized auditing firm. They also offer training and education resources so that companies can build stronger internal security teams.

## Why blockchain security matters

As the use of blockchain technology grows, so too does the need for robust security solutions. That's because blockchain-based applications are often built on top of open-source smart contracts, which are notoriously difficult to secure. Hackers have taken advantage of this fact to steal millions of dollars worth of digital assets from exchanges, wallets, and other blockchain-based applications.

In order to prevent these kinds of attacks from happening in the future, it's important for companies to build robust security teams and adopt best practices for secure coding and auditing smart contracts. That's where Secure3 comes in. By partnering with Secure3, we are sending a clear message that we take the security of our digital assets seriously and are committed to protecting them against all threats.

## What does BlockEden.xyz do?

BlockEden.xyz provides a set of APIs that makes it easy for developers to connect to the Aptos and Sui networks. Our platform enables developers to quickly and securely build decentralized applications (DApps). In addition, we offer tools that help developers to track their DApp usage and manage their user keys.

We believe that our platform will help to accelerate the development of the Aptos and Sui ecosystems. Our goal is to make it easy for developers to build DApps on Aptos and Sui, so that more people can use these blockchains to fulfill their decentralized needs.
