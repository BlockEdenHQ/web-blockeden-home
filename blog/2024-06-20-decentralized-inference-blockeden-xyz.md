BlockEden.xyz, known for its Remote Procedure Call (RPC) infrastructure, is expanding into AI inference services. This evolution leverages its open-source, permissionless design to create a marketplace where model researchers, hardware operators, API providers, and users interact seamlessly. The network's Relay Mining algorithm ensures a transparent and verifiable service, presenting a unique opportunity for large model AI researchers to monetize their work without infrastructure maintenance.

## The Core Problem

The AI landscape faces significant challenges, including:

- **Restricted Model-Serving Environments**: Resource-intensive infrastructure limits AI researchers' ability to experiment with various models.
- **Unsustainable Business Models for Open Source Innovation**: Independent engineers struggle to monetize their work, relying on major infrastructure providers.
- **Unequal Market Access**: Enterprise-grade models dominate, leaving mid-tier models and users underserved.

## BlockEden.xyzâ€™s Unique Value Proposition

BlockEden.xyz addresses these issues by decoupling the infrastructure layer from the product and services layer, ensuring an open and decentralized framework. This setup enables high-quality service delivery and aligns incentives among all network participants.

Key benefits include:

- **Established Network**: Utilizing an existing network of BlockEden.xyz's services to streamline model access and service quality.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each stakeholder focuses on their strengths, improving overall ecosystem efficiency.
- **Incentive Alignment**: Cryptographic proofs and performance measurements drive competition and transparency.
- **Permissionless Models & Supply**: An open marketplace for cost-effective hardware supply.

## Decentralized AI Inference Stakeholders

**Model Providers: Coordinators**

Coordinators manage the product and services layer, optimizing service quality and providing seamless access for applications. Coordinators discreetly ensure supplier integrity by posing as regular users, offering unbiased performance assessments.

**Model Users: Applications**

Applications typically use first-party coordinators but can also access the network with a third-party for enhanced privacy and cost savings. Direct access allows for diverse use case experimentation and eliminates intermediary costs.

**Model Suppliers: Hardware Operators**

Suppliers run inference nodes to earn tokens. Their competencies in DevOps, hardware maintenance, and logging are crucial for network growth. The permissionless approach encourages participation from various hardware providers, including those with idle or dormant resources.

**Model Sources: Engineers & Researchers**

Researchers and institutions that open-source models can earn revenue based on usage. This model incentivizes innovation without the need for infrastructure maintenance, providing a sustainable business model for open-source contributors.
