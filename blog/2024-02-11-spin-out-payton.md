**Step 1: Get Your APT Wallet Ready**

Before you can pay for your subscription with APT, you will need an APT wallet. You can get any wallet that supports Aptos, like [Pontem](https://pontem.network/). Once you have a wallet, make sure it has enough funds to cover the subscription cost. You can transfer money from other wallets or buy more tokens directly from exchanges like Coinbase, [Hippo.space](https://hippo.space/) or [LiquidSwap](https://liquidswap.com/#/).

**Step 2: Go to Our Website and Select the Subscription Plan**

Once your wallet is ready, go to BlockEden. xyz's website https://blockeden.xyz/pricing/ and select the best plan for your needs. Then, click *Pay with crypto* and select *APT* over the *Aptos* network as your payment method. This will generate an address with a QR code containing the recipient's address. Please send the **exact amount of coins** to the listed address. Once this is done, you will see *Payment succeeded* and click the button to get back to the dashboard.

**Step 3: Confirm Your Payment**

When you have completed the transaction, recheck your wallet balance and ensure that the correct amount has been deducted. If everything looks good, then congratulations! You have successfully paid for your subscription using APT tokens! Now all that's left is to start using our services and enjoy all of their benefits!
