It is with great sadness and a heavy heart that we at BlockEden.xyz offer our sincerest condolences to the families and communities affected by the recent earthquake in Turkey and Syria.

Our thoughts are with those who have lost loved ones, homes, and possessions in this tragedy.

The aftermath of this disaster has highlighted the importance of having access to technology and resources to aid in recovery efforts. In light of this, BlockEden.xyz would like to extend a one-year SaaS subscription to those affected by the earthquake in Turkey and Syria. Our software can help those in need to efficiently manage recovery efforts, communicate with loved ones, and access essential resources. We hope that this small gesture can bring some comfort and support in these difficult times.

## How could BlockEden.xyz help with the recovery?

BlockEden.xyz helps developers and creators easily use blockchains like Aptos, Sui, and Ethereum. In this offering, Residents of Turkey and Syria with a verified government-issued ID could get a one-year free subscription (worth $2,400 or $23,988) from us. Of course, we reserve the right of final interpretation of this blog and offering.

Blockchain technology has the potential to aid in disaster recovery in several ways:

**Supply chain management**: In the aftermath of a disaster, it's important to quickly and effectively distribute aid and resources to those in need. Blockchain could create a transparent and secure supply chain for managing donations and supplies, ensuring that aid reaches its intended recipients efficiently and without any tampering or corruption.

**Record Keeping**: After a disaster, it's crucial to maintain accurate records of the damage caused, the resources and aid distributed, and other relevant information. Blockchain technology offers an immutable and transparent record-keeping system that can provide accurate and tamper-proof records, which can be useful in recovery efforts.

**Identity verification**: In the aftermath of a disaster, it's essential to ensure that aid and resources reach the right people, especially in areas with large displaced populations. Blockchain technology could be used to create a decentralized system for verifying identities, ensuring that aid is distributed to those who truly need it.

**Donation tracking**: In a disaster, it's important to ensure that donations are being used effectively. Blockchain technology could be used to track donations and monitor how they are being spent, ensuring accountability and transparency in disaster relief efforts.

Developers could consume our chain APIs or GraphQL APIs to build applications like the above, and non-developers could leverage our [Analytics tool](https://blockeden.xyz/analytics) to create a data visualization dashboard to track data for those scenarios above. If you are interested in accepting donations with a customizable checkout page like the one below, please get in touch with us for details, and we will set it up for you.

However, it's important to note that while blockchain technology has the potential to improve disaster recovery efforts, it's not a silver bullet, and other factors such as infrastructure, logistics, and political will are also important.

## You are not alone

We understand that this tragedy goes beyond the boundaries of technology, and that there is much more that needs to be done to support those affected by the earthquake. We are committed to doing our part in helping those in need, and we encourage others to do the same. Whether it be through donations to relief organizations, volunteering time, or simply sending well wishes, every little bit helps.

To the people of Turkey and Syria, know that you are not alone in this difficult time. The world is thinking of you, and we are here to support you in any way we can.
