## Introduction

The rise of web3 has seen a proliferation of decentralized applications (DApps) platforms, all vying for supremacy. Amid this scene enters BlockEden.xyz, a new player with a unique proposition. This web3 native company has now adopted blockchain technology to better measure the computational expense associated with an API invocation, by introducing the Compute Unit Credit (CUC). But how exactly does this work, and what impact will it have on the API market? Let's break it down.

## BlockEden.xyz: Stepping Into The API Market

BlockEden.xyz has made its entry into the API marketplace, providing services across different platforms such as Sui, Aptos, Solana, and 12 EVM blockchains. But there's something that sets this company apart - it's the way they leverage blockchain technology to quantify Compute Unit Credit, paving the way for a more standardized and comparable API cost structure.

### Understanding Compute Unit Credit

The Compute Unit Credit (CUC) serves as a consistent metric that measures the computational costs tied to an API invocation. This strategy addresses the variations in machine costs for each service, offering a standard way to communicate the price of API invocation and ensuring comparability.

By applying blockchain technology, BlockEden.xyz has created a secure and transparent system where the cost of API services can be fairly compared, enabling developers to make more informed decisions.
