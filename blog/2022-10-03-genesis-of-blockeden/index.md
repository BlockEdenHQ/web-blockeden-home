Block Eden is a one-stop global developer infrastructure of Web3 that
empower dapp developers to quickly innovate, experiment and iterate.

Developers are coming to Web3 to develop the next generation of Dapp.
However, infrastructure work like running blockchain nodes and indexing chain data is slowing down their innovation.

Block Eden solves this problem by providing reliable building blocks
that are easy to integrate and scale with the growth of your business. Building blocks we provide include but are not limited to JSON-RPC API and on-chain data indexing/querying/analyzing.
