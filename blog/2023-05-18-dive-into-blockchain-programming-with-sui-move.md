## Understanding Move: The Programming Language

Before we jump into the tutorial, let's briefly recap what Move is. Created by Facebook's subsidiary, Diem Association (formerly Libra), Move is a statically-typed, resource-oriented programming language. Its design is centered around enforcing safety and security, making it the ideal language for coding blockchain and cryptocurrency projects. The Sui Move is a variant of the Move programming language.

Resources in Move are a key construct that makes it stand out from other blockchain programming languages. These are special types that can't be copied or discarded, only moved between storage locations. This feature allows for precise control over digital assets and significantly mitigates the risk of common security issues, such as double-spending.
